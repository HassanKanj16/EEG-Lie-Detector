# EEG Lie Detector

Lie detection has immense application in crime reduction and control. Current lie detectors, such as polygraphs, often use blood pressure, heart rate, respiration, etc., as indicators of stress. In turn, the level of stress of a partipant can be interpretted as the extent to which they are being honest. However, the fact that participants may become stressed despite being telling the truth renders polygraphs unreliable and unacceptable for industrial use.

We set out to create an improved method for lie detection that takes advantage of EEG signals.
